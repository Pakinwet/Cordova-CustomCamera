The plugin starts the device camera to detect faces in realtime.

It's only available for Android (just made for testing purpose).

The plugin is using the Android built-in face detection feature.<br/>
More details [here](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html#face-detection).

You can see a sample app which uses this plugin [here](https://github.com/valx76/Cordova-CustomCamera-app).
